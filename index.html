Next to you  is an experimental social application that was developed within the scope of <a href="http://www.tut.fi/en/social-technologies/solutions--publications/index.htm">Social Technologies</a> project, in Tampere University of Technology.
Based on proximity, it allows users to automatically exchange pieces of information, called Whispers, with the other users that bass them by.

<p>The Android app can be installed from Google Play store:<br>

<p>The users create their profile by uploading a profile picture and inserting “whispers”. After at least one whisper has been saved, the user’s profile is activated and can be discovered by other users.</p>

<p>The main view contains a list of connections discovered by the user. The first time two users are within each other’s proximity (Bluetooth range), a connection between them is created, and their first whispers are exchanged. A user can edit her whispers and rearrange their order, determining which will be received first by her connections.</p>

<code>_The order of whispers on the profile determines the order in which they will be received by other users_</code></p>

<p>If two users meet again (after at least 5 hours have passed), another exchange of whispers automatically takes place. Users cannot receive more whispers (from each connection) than they have created in their own profile. By tapping on a connection, a user can view another user’s profile, containing the whispers they have received from them (depending on how many times they have met). The user can tap and hold on a whisper to like it.</p>

<p>After a connection between two users has been established, they can exchange text messages by navigating to each other’s profile and tapping on the “Messages” button. If they are in proximity, they can initiate a Face-to-Face confirmation: an image containing 5 figures is shown on user’s A screen, and one of the 5 figures is randomly shown on user’s B screen. User B needs to show his/her screen to user A (provided that they are meeting face-to-face), and user B needs to tap on the corresponding figure on his/her own screen. The process must be repeated successfully 3 times, before a countdown timer runs out! After the confirmation is completed, the users cannot repeat it until the next time they meet. The first time a successful F2F confirmation is achieved, the two users unlock each other’s profile picture, which is now visible on their profile and list of connections.</p>

<p>The users are awarded with unlocking achievements for using the application further: collecting more profiles, receiving many likes for a whisper, sending and receiving messages etc. Each achievement has three ranks; bronze, silver and gold.</p>

<p>The app also features push notifications. The users are notified when a new contact is in proximity, or when they have received a new whisper from an existing connection, when one of their whispers has been liked, when they have received a message or F2F request, when they have unlocked an achievement etc.</p>
